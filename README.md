# moon cycle and sleep

This is a simple script to read data from an Oura ring json export and plot it against the moon cycle phase, based on what is shown in "Moonstruck sleep: Synchronization of human sleep with the moon cycle under field conditions", Casiraghi et al (link here: https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/7/5/eabe0465.full)

# Usage
Get the code, then create a 'data' folder, at the same level as the already present 'figures' folder. Put your Oura ring data in there. You can get your Oura ring data by loggin in at Oura Cloud and then downloading the JSON including all your data

Rename the file to oura.json and put it in the data folder, then run the script
